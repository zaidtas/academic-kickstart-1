# Biography


<p align="justify">I'm a research assistant at <a href="http://focus.ece.ufl.edu/">FOCUS Lab </a> under <a href="https://www.ece.ufl.edu/users/koppal-sanjeev-j">Prof. Sanjeev Koppal</a> at University of Florida (UF). I wrote my Master's thesis on "Adaptive Depth Sensing" in the summer of 2018 at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at UF. Prior to this, I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2016 from IIT Kanpur, where I was fortunate to get to work with <a href="http://home.iitk.ac.in/~adutta/">Prof. Ashish Dutta</a>. Earlier, I'd visited <a href="http://www.achimmenges.net/">Prof. Achim Menges's </a> group at University of Stuttgart, Germany in the summer of 2015.</p>

<p align="justify">I am interested in designing novel sensors and inference algorithms for advancements in perception by combining computational displays with computational imaging techniques. I work at the intersection of optics, signal processing, computer vision, robotics and machine learning.</p>
